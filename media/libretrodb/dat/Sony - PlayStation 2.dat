It is usually performed to music and may be practiced in a group setting led by an instructor (fitness professional), although it can be done solo and without musical accompaniment. With the goal of preventing illness and promoting physical fitness, practitioners perform various routines comprising a number of different dance-like exercises. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and complexity. Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their fitness level. Many gyms offer a variety of aerobic classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class."

	description "Azur & Asmar: The Princes' Quest (French: Azur et Asmar) is a 2006 French-Spanish-Belgium-Italy animated fairytale fantasy film written and directed by Michel Ocelot and animated at the Paris animation and visual effects studio Mac Guff Ligne. It is Ocelot's fourth feature, though his first wholly original creation since Kirikou and the Sorceress, and his first use of 3D computer graphics, albeit an atypical employment of this medium with two-dimensional, painted backgrounds and non-photorealistic rendering. Like most of his films it is an original fairy tale, in this case inspired by the folklore (including, but not limited to, the One Thousand and One Nights) and decorative art of North Africa and the Middle East and with an increased degree of characterisation relative to his previous works which pushes it into the genre of fairytale fantasy."

Despair blankets the countryside, but the ancient prophecies that warned of these dark days also spoke of a great hero who would eventually rise to strike down the villain and free the land from his dreadful curse. Brave and powerful warriors from all walks of life in Barbaria now come forward, each with his or her own personal motivation to seek the destruction of the evil Zaugg."

A powerful and evil being known only as Zaugg has cursed the land of Barbaria with his merciless greed and vile magic. Despair blankets the countryside, but the ancient prophecies that warned of these dark days also spoke of a great hero who would eventually rise to strike down the villain and free the land from his dreadful curse. Brave and powerful warriors from all walks of life in Barbaria now come forward, each with his or her own personal motivation to seek the destruction of the evil Zaugg."

Slot machines are also known as one-armed bandits because they were originally operated by a lever on the side of the machine (the arm) instead of a button on the front panel, and because of their ability to leave the gamer penniless (bandit). Many modern machines still have a legacy lever in addition to the button."

Of interest to technical-minded fighters are the reversals that may be pulled off when hacking away and the adjunctive battle scenes that are triggered by well-timed reversals. As Gatsu rages on through the ranks successfully, his array of killing moves improve and are honed to razor-like edge. Literally. During tight spots, support from comrades may be called upon to escape hairy situations. The standard attack is a sweeping slash which chops monsters in half or at least busts them up pretty badly. During one memorable reversal cinema, there's a brutal leaping attack where Gatsu jumps up and digs his massive sword into the bowels of a hapless creature until it splits in half. Decapitations, severed limbs, and other gory sights are routine since Gatsu is the man when it's time to create killing fields."

When choosing places to take your kids, their personality parameters change. When your kids at last go job hunting, the options available to them will depend on what they learned in school. The game is filled with event scenes such as sports meets and the start of school."

	description "Bouken Shounen is a manga series of short stories by Mitsuru Adachi which appeared about once a year in Shogakukan's Big Comic Original between 1998 and 2006. The title translates to 'Adventure Boys.' All seven stories deal with grown men, each dealing with some aspect of his past. Some of the stories have slight fantasy elements to them, while others use flashbacks. The only common feature is a grown-up protagonist somehow coming face-to-face with his childhood past, in a testament to the loss of youth, the disillusionment of growing old, and nostalgia for better times. In the Adachi pantheon, this is a rare diametric view of his eternal theme of 'youth,' in this case youth as seen through the lens of the past."

The storyline takes place around the time period of the fifth season, which means Spike is now an unofficial member of the Scoobie Gang and Willow is well on her way to becoming a full-fledged witch."

Its subdivisions, and indeed its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latin name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerstätten. These are sites of exceptional preservation, where 'soft' parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. This means that our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods."

More a sardonic pastiche of 1980s high school films than a violent ode to the publisher's Grand Theft Auto past, Bully carefully re-creates an academic atmosphere with classrooms, lunch periods, socializing with other students, season-related events, and plenty of areas to explore before curfew. Fifteen-year-old Jimmy Hopkins reluctantly attends the strict Bullworth Academy for a year, during which he'll develop skills, befriend peers, romance girls, and make a name for himself as either a hero or a miscreant."

This time the story is based on the classic Italian folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression. The story itself was based in the Kingdom of Naples, at that time the most important political and cultural center of Southern Italy and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the Neapolitan dialect. It was later reprised, along with other Basile's tales, by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé (1697), and by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales (1812)."

Like most other 'extreme sports' games, it features over-the-top tricks and empowering combo moves, but it also rewards players for orchestrating the most spectacular, sadistic crashes they can. Extra points are earned for bailing out of impossible tricks and causing lots of damage and destruction, to the interactive environments as well as to the rider's own body. A variety of off-road vehicles are available, including mini-bikes, ATVs, and even riding lawn mowers and an ice cream truck. Crusty Demons was developed by the U.K.'s Climax Group, also known for its ATV Offroad Fury and ATV: Quad Power Racing games."

	description "In this adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved stories, players embark on a quest that will lead them through the events of all three films, in the roles of custom characters they create. Developed by EA's Redwood Shores studio, Lord of the Rings: The Third Age separates itself from its predecessors with its turn-based RPG format -- it has been noted by designers that those who have played Final Fantasy should find the system familiar. Also notable is the ability to ride a horse or a warg in combat, both of which demand special skills."

The game is inspired by the battle scenes found therein. The story is told through footage from the movie that slowly melds to in-game cinematic screens, all explaining the origin of The Ring and those who covet it. Players choose from three warrior characters, patterned after their on-screen personas: Legolas the Elf, Aragorn the Ranger, or Gimli the Dwarf. Then, embark on a quest that spans a multitude of levels. Players will revisit such familiar locales as Fangorn Forest and the Mines of Moria."

	description "Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair is an action-adventure video game released in 2002 by Dragonstone Software. The game is based on Cinematronics' 1983 laserdisc arcade game Dragon's Lair, and follows a similar story; the hero, Dirk the Daring, must enter the evil wizard Mordroc's castle to rescue Princess Daphne from a dragon. Many of the characters and locations from the 1983 original make appearances in the game, along with new puzzles, rooms and enemies. Animator and director Don Bluth, who produced the cartoon animation for the arcade original, also produced two new animated sequences for the opening and ending of the game. The game uses cel shading to mimic the distinctive style of the original."

	description "This 3D platform puzzle game is based on the DreamWorks film of the same title and release time. Players take control of four unlikely animal companions: Alex, the brave lion; Marty, the idealistic zebra; Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe; and Gloria, the heavyweight hippo. The animals have joined forces to try to escape from their current confinement in the Central Park Zoo. Each creature has a special skill, and finding the best use for these abilities can be key to making it through each zoo-based level. The animals abilities become more powerful as players progress, and between-level mini-games feature supporting characters from the film, such as the penguins and the lemurs."

Subsequent mixes have been released approximately once a year. In 2010, a series XG was introduced, adding a floor tom, left cymbal and left pedal to the cabinet setup. To focus on the new game, development ceased for the original version, with the last mix V8 released in 2011. The most recent arcade version is DrumMania XG2, which was released on March 9, 2011."

Equipment management adds depth to the game and actually affects the character's physical appearance. Magic Palmira crystals, which have different effects depending on how they are used, add a degree of strategy for the role-player."

Fed up with consumerist American culture, a fight club is founded as a new type of therapy through bare-knuckle fighting. The game focuses on the fights and uses many characters and environments from the original story. You can create a new fighter or clone one of the generated characters. There are three general fighting styles to choose from: grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points (CDP's) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character."

The events of the game take place two years after Yuna and her guardians defeated Sin in Final Fantasy X, and peace was restored in Spira. The Yevon religion has all but disappeared, and two political factions begin to compete for dominance: the Youth League, led by Mevyn Nooj, and the New Yevon Party, led by Praetor Baralai. Meanwhile, Yuna's cousin Rikku finds a strange sphere that mysteriously shows an image resembling Tidus, Yuna's one and only love. Rikku brings the sphere to Yuna. Determined to discover the truth behind the mystery, Yuna organizes a journey of 'sphere-hunting', to collect more spheres scattered around the world and perhaps find Tidus."

It tells of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre."

The aim is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and touching a series of four bases arranged at the corners of a ninety-foot diamond. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to stop them from scoring runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a teammate's hit or other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn at bat for each team constitutes an inning and nine innings make up a professional game. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins."

Players alternate between control of two lead characters: the young, lithe Yoshitsune, who wields twin samurai blades, and the grizzled, burly Benkei, who fights with an enormous club. Success in battle allows players to gradually upgrade their characters' skills. The game's story leads them on a journey of discovery and honor, through a foreign land where they are often met with distrust and aggression."

Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner."

H2O is Makura's first game; a sequel named vafter and another was later produced in October 2007. The gameplay in H2O follows a plot line that offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the three female main characters. There are two modes of gameplay, the Blindness Effect and Normal Effect, where the former plays on the fact that the protagonist is blind, and the latter mode removes the added element of gameplay the Blindness Effect has. The story is broken into three parts: the original introduction and meeting, following by a separation and reunion, and finally ending with the protagonist choosing one of the girls and spending the rest of the game with her."

Taking the role of one of four family members, players seek angler immortality by catching the legendary and elusive big fish known as 'the River King.' Of course, there's also much to do between trips to the waterside, such as collecting rare items, trading for better equipment at shops, and making new friends. While the publisher's Harvest Moon companion series gained popularity with multiple releases throughout the 128-bit generation, A Wonderful Journey is the first River King game produced for North American PS2s."

Unlike previous incarnations where the main objective was to resurrect a dying farm and ultimately turn a profit, this PS2 title presents players with a slightly more desperate predicament: The land upon which the village is built has been earmarked for the development of a new resort complex. Construction begins in exactly one year and in that time you'll have to find a way to save the village. Incidentally, there are nine different ways that this can be achieved, providing nine different game endings."

The people of his village, fearful of retribution from above, feel they have no choice but to sacrifice this mutant child to appease their gods. To that end, they have taken this boy, named Ico, to a massive, supposedly deserted castle and left him in a giant urn. But when the urn breaks, spilling Ico into the bowels of the fortress, he will soon find his adventure is just beginning. Along the way he'll meet a mysterious princess who has been held captive in the castle for untold years.

The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough."

Five modes of play are offered: Arcade, Championship, Time Trial, Multiplayer, and Freestyle. The Championship mode makes up the bulk of the experience, awarding points based upon the player's final position in each race. The objective is to be the rider with the most points at the end of the season. The Arcade mode on the other hand forces the player to reach checkpoints within a given time limit in order to continue with the race. The freestyle arena is a lone pursuit, requiring the player to perform various tricks with the aid of waves and ramps littered around the open area. Tricks are performed using button and directional pad combinations and are judged according to composition, appeal and technical merit, among others."

Jumper's heavy emphasis on combat lets players take advantage of Griffin's unique abilities to perform three different kinds of dynamic 'jumps.' The Combat Jump lets players instantaneously move around Paladins in the midst of a fight sequence, the Traversal Jump allows gamers to pick a spot in the environment and jump to it, and the Finishing Jump lets players move enemies to completely new locations."

Ebizo gave up his life of crime over a decade ago to take care of a little girl named Suzuna. Back then, he was a member of the Gingarasu, a crew of thieves who stole from the wealthy and distributed the spoils to the poor. While on an outing with his partner Ainosuke, Ebizo found and rescued Suzuna from an incident in which her parents were killed by criminals. With new responsibilities, Ebizo raised Suzuna like a daughter and walked away from the Gingarasu."

	description "Kanon is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Key released on June 4, 1999 for Windows PCs. Key later released versions of Kanon without the erotic content, and the game was ported to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The story follows the life of Yuichi Aizawa, a high school student who returns to a city he last visited seven years prior, and he has little recollection of the events from back then. He meets several girls and slowly regains his lost memories. The gameplay in Kanon follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. The game once ranked as the second best-selling PC game sold in Japan, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Kanon has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms."

As the story goes, a new and powerful gang has begun to assert its power amongst the high schools in the area by way of brute force.

	description "An original title from Sony Computer Entertainment, Kinetica is a high-speed futuristic racer akin to the likes of XG3 Extreme G Racing. In stark contrast to more conventional forms of racing, the racers in Kinetica wear futuristic suits with wheels attached to their hands and feet. As a result, the racers themselves become the vehicles. Far from a mere cosmetic choice, these suits play an integral part of the gameplay. Free from the hulking vehicles found in similar games, these racers can move their limbs independently, and as such, can perform a host of tricks and stunts. Players are required to execute these stunts by performing a combination of directional movements while holding the R1 button down. Correctly executing tricks fills a boost meter, which, once completed, provides the character with a limited speed boost."

game (

	serial "SLES-53645"
	description "This fantasy RPG sends players through a medieval Europe of fairy tales, on a noble quest to save the good land from an unholy menace. The action features fast-paced swords and sorcery, and the storyline branches according to choices the player makes along the way. Based on StarBreeze's original Knights of the Temple (previously available in Europe), the game puts players in the role of Paul de Raque, who is now Grand Master of the Order. Haunted by dreams of an undead invasion, the brave Templar travels the lands in search of a powerful artifact hidden in an ancient undersea fortress. Once the single-player story is finished and the world is once again safe (until the next game, at least), players can hack-and-slash online with their choice of multiplayer characters"

Facing and surmounting self doubt, arduous training, and rivalries, Hoshi Hyuuma eventually reaches his goals and becomes a pitcher with the Giants. Similar to Ashita no Joe, the manga would eventually also hit the big time with anime episode productions. Hoshi owns some batters by performing something called 'Big League Pitch #2' where his leg kicks up a cloud of dirt on the mound, obscuring the hitter's view as the ball zooms towards him. One memorable episode of the anime is built around a single pitch from Hoshi to batter."

The character with the most points after the gamut of courses is declared the winner and awarded tokens, which in turn can be used to unlock hidden items, such as character art and even a Looney Tunes movie. Incidentally, tokens are the pervading requirement across many of the game's modes, and are also awarded for outstanding achievements in the Race, Time Trial, and Challenge modes. The bulk of the gameplay is to be found in the Race mode, where players can choose their racer and track.

Tolkien's beloved stories, players embark on a quest that will lead them through the events of all three films, in the roles of custom characters they create. Developed by EA's Redwood Shores studio, Lord of the Rings: The Third Age separates itself from its predecessors with its turn-based RPG format -- it has been noted by designers that those who have played Final Fantasy should find the system familiar. Also notable is the ability to ride a horse or a warg in combat, both of which demand special skills."

	description "Although he's been traveling the world for decades in search of riches, love, and adventure, Lupin the 3rd pays his first visit to North American console gamers in this Bandai release for the PlayStation 2. Based on the popular anime (which is itself based on early-20th century stories by French author Maurice Leblanc), this game puts players in control of Lupin, grandson of the world's most celebrated gentleman thief, who is joined by his constant companions Jigen the sharpshooter, Goemon the rogue samurai, and his dangerously alluring love-interest Fujiko. Lupin's nemesis Zenigata is also featured, so it's a safe bet the police inspector will almost nab the playboy thief at least once or twice before this adventure is finished."

	description "Lupin Sansei - Columbus no Isan wa Akenisomaru: The subtitle of the second Lupin game on PS2 translates roughly to 'The Inheritance of Columbus.' Join Lupin crew in a new 3-D adventure with polished visuals which make the Lupin gang somewhat more rounded than they should be. These are sharp-edged characters and the cuddly look does them a disservice. Lupin looks particularly 'off' in his PS2 incarnation. Game wise however, the control and action follow closely in the footsteps of the original PS2 Lupin III game subtitled Majutsu no Isan."

However, when they arrive at the meeting point, a mafia boss named Kouring shows up, demanding Lupin's cooperation in exchange for Fujiko's life. Of course, Lupin is having none of that, and tries to rescue Fujiko himself, but winds up cursed by an ancient black art, which will kill him in three days. Ancient documents that Fujiko found show that the Cang dynasty treasure she's looking for may also hold the key to curing Lupin's curse. But with only three days, will they be able to find the treasure and save Lupin's life?"

This means that the player constantly moves downwards while avoiding obstacles and - if he is in range - hit an opponent to hinder his progress. The main objective is of course to be the first one to cross the finishing line but prize money is also rewarded for stunts - opportunities for them are plentiful on the 27 courses. An important point about them is that they are branching, meaning they feature multiple paths and shortcuts."

The developers at Capcom promise a more engrossing story this time around and have removed the hub screen, meaning each level flows into the next. There are 26 levels in all spread across six different environments."

In a quick and bloody coup, the prime minister of North Korea has been displaced by a power-hungry general called Sung, who now threatens the world with nuclear attack. In the role of an American, British, or Swedish soldier of fortune, players choose their patron and price, and then go to work at eliminating the 52 most wanted perpetrators of the new North Korean regime. Each target is assigned a different playing card, for easy reference."

	description "Adventuresome gamers aim to eliminate a maniacal dictator -- for the good of humanity, as well as significant monetary compensation from the highest bidder. As its title suggests, Mercenaries puts players in the roles of soldiers for hire, who find ample opportunities for employment as an unexpected menace leads the nations of the world to the brink of disaster. In a quick and bloody coup, the prime minister of North Korea has been displaced by a power-hungry general called Sung, who now threatens the world with nuclear attack. In the role of an American, British, or Swedish soldier of fortune, players choose their patron and price, and then go to work at eliminating the 52 most wanted perpetrators of the new North Korean regime. Each target is assigned a different playing card, for easy reference."

In this version however, all sides team up to combat a threat together. The four original heroes, Marco, Tarma, Fio and Eri, are joined by Ralf and Clark, of King of Fighters and Ikari Warriors fame, each with different attributes and a special ability. The characters also vary by running speed, the defense abilities when driving vehicles, and the amount of ammo received."

	description "In Mister Mosquito, players enter the virtual household of the Yamada family in the role of a tiny, uninvited guest. According to the game's introduction, the title character needs to drink as much blood as he can to be ready for winter, but his suburban hosts are not the most willing donors. In fact, the Yamada family members would like nothing better than to swat him out of existence, once and for all. The rules for survival quickly become clear: Keep hidden, don't get squashed, and watch as the family's frustration level grows."

As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels. Visual novels are distinguished from other game types by their extremely minimal gameplay. Typically the majority of player interaction is limited to clicking to keep the text, graphics and sound moving (most recent games offer 'play' or 'fast-forward' toggles that make even this unnecessary)."

Recreational and sport fishing are fishing primarily for pleasure or competition. Recreational fishing has conventions, rules, licensing restrictions and laws that limit the way in which fish may be caught; typically, these prohibit the use of nets and the catching of fish with hooks not in the mouth."

According to the game's introduction, the title character needs to drink as much blood as he can to be ready for winter, but his suburban hosts are not the most willing donors. In fact, the Yamada family members would like nothing better than to swat him out of existence, once and for all. The rules for survival quickly become clear: Keep hidden, don't get squashed, and watch as the family's frustration level grows."

Set in the outskirts of the city, you begin by declaring a class allegiance, picking your crew, and finally, deciding which of the 50 tunable cars you want to make your own. Select a tuner, American muscle, or exotic car, and then begin your ride to the top. You may also use the 'Autosculpt' feature to create a completely customized car if no existing car suits your needs. Selecting your crew is important because each member has a special skill that can help you make it to the finish line first.

	description "Sumo is a competitive full-contact sport where a wrestler (rikishi) attempts to force another wrestler out of a circular ring (dohyo) or to touch the ground with anything other than the soles of the feet. The sport originated in Japan, the only country where it is practiced professionally. It is generally considered to be a gendai budo (a modern Japanese martial art), though this definition is incorrect as the sport has a history spanning many centuries."

With his students Magnus and Cleo, he'll end up on Chaos Island, where they'll have to shift through time to find the various pieces of the shattered Crystal Egg in order to return the stream of time to its proper flow."

	description "This sequel to Pac-Man World has the circular yellow star running and jumping through a 3D world instead of the side-scrolling stages found in the original. While clumsily making their way through Pac-Land, the four ghosts inadvertently plucked magical golden fruit from a tree in the center of Pac-Village. This awakened a dark creature named Spooky, who orders the ghosts to hide the fruit throughout the land. Thus begins a quest to regain the golden fruit across six multi-staged areas: Forest, Tree Tops, Snow Mountain, Lava, Ocean, and Ghost Island."

Over thirty endings await."

Grass, clay, and hardcourt surfaces provide for significantly different play mechanics, such as lower bounce or faster ball speed. Players have a variety of shots at their disposal, and by double-tapping the requisite button as the ball makes contact with the racket, it's possible to increase the power of the shot. Two unique control schemes are offered, for both novice and expert gamers."

	description "Created by the Tecmo development team responsible for the Deception series of games, Fatal Frame is a survival horror title based on the ancient belief that a camera can capture one's soul. As Miku, the younger sister of Mafuyu Hinasaki, players must explore Himuro Mansion in search of the girl's missing brother. The title is apparently based upon a true story, though certain aspects of the game have no doubt been fabricated to make it a more enjoyable video game experience."

Players can leave their car before entering a race to check out the competition at the pit areas, glean some information at the local bar, perform tune-ups, and embark on brief missions to further the story. The heart of the game is the racing competition, where players hit the pedal to the metal on a variety of outdoor venues. The environment is also interactive, to the point where cars can smash through wooden barriers, send piles of stacked tires bouncing along the road, and knock orange cones flying into the distance. A number of jumps are also available, to catch some air."

The game was released in Japan under the main title Reiselied, which is a German word for 'traveling song,' with 'Ephemeral Fantasia' as the subtitle. In either version, the player takes on the role of a young bard named Mouse and the adventure takes place in real time. This means that in order to accomplish certain tasks or meet certain NPC's, the hero must not only have the right items at the right place, but also be there at the right time. Night changes to day, and back again, and again until the hero gets it right."

Taking the role of one of four family members, players seek angler immortality by catching the legendary and elusive big fish known as 'the River King.' Of course, there's also much to do between trips to the waterside, such as collecting rare items, trading for better equipment at shops, and making new friends. While the publisher's Harvest Moon companion series gained popularity with multiple releases throughout the 128-bit generation, A Wonderful Journey is the first River King game produced for North American PS2s."

	description "Disaster Report casts players in the role of a reporter named Keith Helm trying to uncover the story of a lifetime: the person or persons responsible for the collapse of an entire city. The problem? The reporter is in the city as it starts crumbling into the ocean. Armed only with a backpack, a map, and a compass, players must navigate their way through the ravaged urban landscapes while piecing together the clues behind the city's downfall. Fire, earthquakes, collapsing buildings, and other dangers can strike without warning, and a number of citizens may be trapped in harm's way."

	description "Developers at Acquire, whose past credits include the Tenchu series of games, are the people responsible for the action-adventure title Way of the Samurai. As a masterless samurai, you happen upon a small village embroiled in a violent conflict between two clans. The part your character plays is entirely up to you; the branching storyline makes provisions for the samurai to choose to join either side in the conflict, or simply to aid the villagers, if and when needed. During conversations with the local populace, you're presented with a number of different replies and your choices will alter the demeanor and attitude of the other characters. Action-and-consequence plays a vital role in the game and hastily made decisions can greatly affect the duration of your stay in Rokkotsu Pass. Adding to the character's enigmatic nature (your actions largely define his personality) is the player's ability to customize the overall look of the samurai before beginning the adventure."

	description "Pachinko is a Japanese gaming device used for amusement and gambling. A pachinko machine resembles a vertical pinball machine, but with no flippers and a large number of relatively small balls. The player fires a ball up into the machine, controlling only its initial speed. The ball then cascades down through a dense forest of pins. In most cases, the ball falls to the bottom and is lost, but if it instead goes into certain pockets, more balls are released as a jackpot. Pachinko machines were originally strictly mechanical, but modern ones have incorporated extensive electronics, becoming similar to video slot machines."

	description "Sega Ages 2500 Series Vol.02 - Monaco GP let you relive the heyday of the 8-bit generation with a blast back to one of Sega's earliest racing games - Monaco GP. Viewed from a 3/4 overhead perspective, drivers take control of a formula racing vehicle and struggle against hairpin turns, ardent rivals and a relentless timer. Arrows appear at the top of the screen to warn of imminent turns and perhaps serve as Pavlovian signals to apply the brakes and start shifting your racer to compensate for the curvature of the road."

	description "When terrorists led by Mr. Big take over a skyscraper and nab the President's daughter, two super cops are called in to address the situation. Swooping in on a helicopter and entering through a floor of the building by way of fire escape, players have to make their way up to the top for the final battle against a mighty boss man. Miniature side game sequences pop up from time to time to break up the punch 'n kick action. The scenario in Dynamite Deka may be likened to the Diehard movies where Bruce Willis' John McClaine overcame and eventually dominated a group of mayhem-minded rabble rousers. The male lead in Dynamite Deka bears a striking resemblance to the American actor and the skyscraper appears to have been modeled directly after Nakatomi Tower."

A notable feature of the game is the integration of real J-pop songs into the gameplay, and the ability to watch and listen to the songs again once you have mastered them in-game, as well as the fact that the main character has a voice (many otome games' main characters are not voice acted). The publisher classifies it as a love adventure game."

This PS2 game charges players with tasks familiar in two of the most important development simulations on the PC, SimCity and The Sims. Not only must the player design the layout of a new city, but also encourage a blossoming social life for its citizens. Instead of directing from the perspective of an ethereal, godlike overseer, however, Metropolismania players must build their worlds by hand, in person."

Siren is set apart from similar macabre adventures by its heroes' ability to 'sightjack' the first-person perspectives of other characters in the game. Using the analog stick like a fine-tuning dial on an old TV set, players can pick up and hone in on the energy of nearby zombie-like men and women, which are common enemies in the game, and see the world from their points of view. Once found and fine-tuned, up to four such out-of-body perspectives can be stored and selected with a button press, allowing wily survivalists to survey an entire area without stepping into danger themselves."

	description "Players tune in to a vision of the living dead in this PS2-exclusive survival-horror game. Siren is set apart from similar macabre adventures by its heroes' ability to 'sightjack' the first-person perspectives of other characters in the game. Using the analog stick like a fine-tuning dial on an old TV set, players can pick up and hone in on the energy of nearby zombie-like men and women, which are common enemies in the game, and see the world from their points of view. Once found and fine-tuned, up to four such out-of-body perspectives can be stored and selected with a button press, allowing wily survivalists to survey an entire area without stepping into danger themselves."

	description "Taking place within the time period between Star Wars: Episode I and Episode II, Bounty Hunter chronicles the story of the ruthless Jango Fett as he journeys through the underbelly of the Star Wars universe to hunt down a rogue Dark Jedi. Boba Fett's father wears similar armor as his bounty hunter son, which means he can fly short distances with the use of a jetpack. Played from a third-person perspective, the game features a total of 18 levels spread across six chapters. Each level features primary and secondary objectives, the majority of which involve tracking down various thugs and capturing them dead or alive. To help in his pursuit, Jango Fett can use his trademark dual blasters, a flamethrower, thermal grenades, toxic darts, a sniper rifle, whipcord, and two types of jetpack-mounted missiles."

	description "Running concurrent with the events in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter -- the sequel to the original Star Wars: Starfighter -- focuses on Jedi Master Adi Gallia's efforts to thwart the nefarious scheme of Count Dooku, who wishes to diminish the influence of the Jedi Council by swaying star systems away from the Republic. Gameplay remains true to the original, with only selective changes made. The two most notable changes are that the number of playable characters is down from three to two (Nym being the only character to return from the first game) and players are now able to use a host of Force Powers in combat, in lieu of actual secondary ship weapons."

In the style of the TV series, core gameplay involves high-speed chases through a three-dimensional Bay City. Players are motivated to perform big jumps and other high-speed feats by more than just the goal of catching the criminal, however. Starsky and Hutch must do their job with style -- or not at all."

	description "Sega's hit GameCube series rolls onto Xbox and PlayStation 2, in a 'Deluxe' version that includes the levels, modes, and options of both original Super Monkey Ball games, as well as new content. As in earlier editions, players tilt increasingly complicated platform game boards in order to cause clear balls containing cute, cartoonish monkeys to roll across the course and through a goal marker. Super Monkey Ball Deluxe contains a total of 300 single-player stages -- 114 taken from the original Super Monkey Ball, 140 from Super Monkey Ball 2, and another 46 that are new to this version of the game. All 12 party games featured in earlier editions are included here as well, along with 6 new multiplayer competitions."

	description "Panic! (known as Switch! in Japan) is a video game for the Mega-CD that involves pressing numerous buttons in order to transverse a young boy, called Slap, or his dog, called Stick, through a complex labyrinth. The game was originally released in Japan, and had some risque 'gags' that were assumed to be edited out if the game ever got a North American release. However, in 1994, Data East USA decided to publish the game in North America for the Sega CD, renamed but otherwise uncut, except for two deleted stages: Level 2-B, a scene with a cigarette machine, excluded because of the tobacco reference, and Level 9-B, featuring a Japanese typewriter. The level 12-D is notorious for sending the player to the Japanese Mega-CD BIOS screen, but this scene was not changed in the American version and still showed the Japanese BIOS screen instead of the American one. The game is compatible with the Sega Mega Mouse. In 2002, the game was released for the PlayStation 2."

Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough."

	description "Nina Williams, the mysterious assassin introduced in Namco's popular Tekken series of 3D fighting games, strikes out on her own in this action-oriented adventure. In the game the player controls the assassin Nina Williams as she fights to take down terrorist organization/evil corporation Kometa. She infiltrated a luxury cruise ship, Amphitrite, as a fighter in an illegal fighting tournament. The mission was to find out more about this organization, and two other CIA operatives were sent onboard the cruiser. Nina was but a support member of the team, not to take anything in her own hands unless her colleagues fail. Yet, when she is taken captive, and receives the news of mission failed, she's about to take matters into her own hands, and do what she's trained to do... sweep off the decks."

	description "In the most dangerous part of town, in a neighborhood dwarfed by the Mikado Group's massive headquarters, there sits a bar called Fate. In this seedy district, every place of business needs protection, and Fate has it three times over with a trio of bouncers, each with distinct styles and personalities, and each with a mysterious past. There is the massive Volt, strong and silent type with a pierced face and horn implants jutting out of his forehead; Kao, the multi-tattooed wise-cracker who's as handy with a joke as he is with a fist to the face; and Sion, a young fighter who brims over with a quiet sorrow. Together, they keep Fate clean of the riff-raff, while Sion takes care of a once homeless girl named Dominique Cross, who has become sort of the mascot of the bar itself."

	description "In the most dangerous part of town, in a neighborhood dwarfed by the Mikado Group's massive headquarters, there sits a bar called Fate. In this seedy district, every place of business needs protection, and Fate has it three times over with a trio of bouncers, each with distinct styles and personalities, and each with a mysterious past. There is the massive Volt, strong and silent type with a pierced face and horn implants jutting out of his forehead; Kao, the multi-tattooed wise-cracker who's as handy with a joke as he is with a fist to the face; and Sion, a young fighter who brims over with a quiet sorrow. Together, they keep Fate clean of the riff-raff, while Sion takes care of a once homeless girl named Dominique Cross, who has become sort of the mascot of the bar itself."

	description "Gamers drive their virtual alter egos toward greatness, as the second generation of 'people simulation' gets a life on consoles. Though it features the same charming style and real-world challenges, the PlayStation 2 version of Sims 2 has been customized for the console. As in the console ports of the original Sims game, there is more of a focus on the player's main character, and less on the neighborhood interactions as a whole. Along this line, the most obvious difference between the computer and console versions of Sims 2 may be in the way players control their characters. Instead of a point-and-click strategy-game styled interface, players take direct control of their console characters, 'driving' them around the game world with the analog stick (as in a third-person RPG)."

	description "Combining the stealth, tactics, and action popularized in both the Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon franchises, Splinter Cell represents a new Tom Clancy series featuring a single character instead of the team-oriented play found in Red Storm's successful squad-based shooter games. The title alludes to the secret organization players are part of, an offshoot of the NSA called Third Echelon, whose members rigorously serve to protect America using whatever means necessary."

	description "In this underwater action-adventure, players take the role of the title character: a small, freshwater fish who finds himself in a (number of) big ponds (not to mention streams, lakes, and rivers). At the beginning of the game, Finny learns from a wizened old turtle that a great destiny lays before him, and that he must leave the safety of his home and travel the wide waters to find it. With representations of over 100 different species of underwater life, the game is full of small bugs and fish for Finny to eat, and large fish and animals that are interested in eating Finny. Unpredictable currents, hidden bonus areas, and (especially) fisherman's lures all pose additional challenges the small fry protagonist must face."

	description "Based upon the women's tennis circuit, WTA Tour Tennis lets players take to the court with 20 professional players, including Jelena Dokic, Martina Hingis, Serena Williams, Jennifer Capriati, and Lindsay Davenport. Grass, clay, and hardcourt surfaces provide for significantly different play mechanics, such as lower bounce or faster ball speed. Players have a variety of shots at their disposal, and by double-tapping the requisite button as the ball makes contact with the racket, it's possible to increase the power of the shot. Two unique control schemes are offered, for both novice and expert gamers."

The Championship mode makes up the bulk of the experience, awarding points based upon the player's final position in each race. The objective is to be the rider with the most points at the end of the season. The Arcade mode on the other hand forces the player to reach checkpoints within a given time limit in order to continue with the race. The freestyle arena is a lone pursuit, requiring the player to perform various tricks with the aid of waves and ramps littered around the open area. Tricks are performed using button and directional pad combinations and are judged according to composition, appeal and technical merit, among others."

As a masterless samurai, you happen upon a small village embroiled in a violent conflict between two clans. The part your character plays is entirely up to you; the branching storyline makes provisions for the samurai to choose to join either side in the conflict, or simply to aid the villagers, if and when needed. During conversations with the local populace, you're presented with a number of different replies and your choices will alter the demeanor and attitude of the other characters. Action-and-consequence plays a vital role in the game and hastily made decisions can greatly affect the duration of your stay in Rokkotsu Pass. Adding to the character's enigmatic nature (your actions largely define his personality) is the player's ability to customize the overall look of the samurai before beginning the adventure."

The added dimension allows players' to view the action first-person, from above in 'blimp' perspective or from behind their invertebrate warriors. It also creates yet another variable for which to account when firing off any of the game's numerous, unpredictable weapons. Battlefield landscapes are randomly generated and, of course, fully deformable."

	description "Worms Blast is a puzzle game similar in concept to Puzzle Bobble, with several important distinctions and gameplay features taken from Worms games. Instead of releasing and matching bubbles, the player has to color blocks on a hexagonal grid. Unlike most Bust-A-Move variants, the player character can move right and left, sailing in a boat. Various weapons, such as bazooka, grenades, dynamite, and others, can be used to fire at the blocks, coloring them on impact. Like in the main, artillery-based Worms games, holding down the fire button increases the power of the weapon, affecting the distance it travels."

As Miku, the younger sister of Mafuyu Hinasaki, players must explore Himuro Mansion in search of the girl's missing brother. The title is apparently based upon a true story, though certain aspects of the game have no doubt been fabricated to make it a more enjoyable video game experience."

	description "Disaster Report casts players in the role of a reporter named Keith Helm trying to uncover the story of a lifetime: the person or persons responsible for the collapse of an entire city. The problem? The reporter is in the city as it starts crumbling into the ocean. Armed only with a backpack, a map, and a compass, players must navigate their way through the ravaged urban landscapes while piecing together the clues behind the city's downfall. Fire, earthquakes, collapsing buildings, and other dangers can strike without warning, and a number of citizens may be trapped in harm's way."
